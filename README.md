# audioReview

This is a simple web app built in Node/React/MySql. It's an audio review app. It allows for simple play back of audio files and provides users an easy way to 
keep notes and likes on each mp3 file. The play functions allow for easy skipping forward through recordings which was important for us.

An uncle of mine passed away years ago and we discovered a bag of very old audio tapes stashed in the attic.
These are the reel to reel audio tapes - old tech. It appears that when this technology was new my late uncle was having fun
by making recordings of various activities; family and friends gathering, pretending to be a sports announcer, interviewing "celebrity" guests etc.
It appears they were recorded in the 1950s and 1960s.

I sourced a company to make digital recordings from the tapes, resulting in 234 mp3 files totaling around 30 hours of audio recordings. So the task was to make
it easy to listen to the mp3s and make notes, who is on there and what are they doing, etc. etc - this to make it easier for others to enjoy listening to our late
family ancestors going about the business of life and entertaining themselves.

So this web app is what I came up with. It works pretty well. I've made no attempt to generalize it for use by others, but feel free to fork and create a PR.
